This contains the R notebooks used to optimize the machine learning portion of the 3P pipeline.

"FeatureSelection_ClassifierTraining" contains the code used to perform feature selection, 
including plotting the feature values and evaluating highly correlated features for the ML optimization dataset. 
It also generates the dotplots to compare different ML models trained using the caretList function from caretEnsemble.

It accompanies Supplemental Figures S6 and S7A.

"IterativeClassifierTraining" shows the results of iterative training on the ML optimization dataset, where
a portion of misidentified cells are added to a portion of the original training set to create a new training set
which contains more "hard-to-classify" cells.

It accompanies Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure S7B-F.
