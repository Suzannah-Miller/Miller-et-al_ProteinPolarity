MaskAndSegmentImages.m provides the MATLAB code for generating image masks and segmentation label matrices.

ExtractFeatures.m provides the MATLAB code for uploading images, masks, and segmentation, and 
extracting the feature data for each cell.

CompileManualScoring.Rmd is the R markdown file for unblinding, compiling, and checking the manual labeling data.

MachineLearning_MCAM-ERM.Rmd is the R markdown file for compiling feature data and performing machine learning 
to classify cells with polarized protein. It also includes code for sampling and blinding cells for manual labeling,
analyzing co-polarization, generating figures, and performing statistics. 
The "Final-pipeline/Input" folder contains the data necessary to run this code. 
The "Final-pipeline/Output" folder contains the supplemental data which was saved in the last two chunks of the markdown file.
