These .Rmd notebooks contain the code for machine learning classification of
the siRNA depletion experiments reported in Figure 6 and Supplemental Figures S6D, S7, and S8.

"CompileManualScoring.Rmd" - code showing how samples of cells were selected and blinded
for manual labeling of the cells used to train ML models. Also shows code used to fill in 
and check raw manual scoring spreadsheets.

"siRNA_MachineLearning.Rmd" - code for classifier training and compilation of data for manual 
co-polarization analysis.

"Sensitivity-Specificity-Precision-FeatureSelection.Rmd" - applies classifier from previous notebook and
saves classified feature data, including the supplemental data tables. 
Samples cells for final testing of machine learning accuracy, excluding any cells used during
iterative classifier training.
Evaluates sensitivity, specificity, and precision for iterative classifier training. 
Also, measures feature importance and generates violin plots of important features as well as boxplots of
Haralick texture features.

"Percent-Polarized-Cells_Figures.Rmd" - Loads the saved output from the previous notebook and quantifies 
the percent of polarized and co-polarized cells, makes bar graphs, and does statistics.
