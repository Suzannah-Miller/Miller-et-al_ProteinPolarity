These .Rmd notebooks contain the code for machine learning classification of
the siRNA depletion experiments reported in Figure 6 and Supplemental Figures S6D, S7, and S8.

"siRNA_MachineLearning.Rmd" - code for classifier training and compilation of data for manual 
co-polarization analysis.

"Sensitivity-Specificity-FeatureSelection.Rmd" - applies classifier from previous notebook and
saves classified feature data, including the supplemental data tables. 
Evaluates sensitivity and specificity for iterative classifier training. Measures
feature importance and generates violin plots of important features as well as boxplots of
Haralick texture features.

"Percent-Polarized-Cells_Figures.Rmd" - Loads the saved output from the previous notebook and quantifies 
the percent of polarized and co-polarized cells, make bar graphs, and do statistics.
